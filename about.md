The Journal Square Community Association represents residents, owners of residential property, and businesses in the Journal Square area.

We serve as a voice for the community in dealing with the city, county, developers, local businesses, and other community groups. We bring people together at monthly meetings so they can connect with their neighbors and remain updated about our neighborhood.

## Our Mission

To promote a clean, green, and safe Journal Square. We advocate for the rights and interests of residents and celebrate the rich history of the area.

## Meetings

Meetings are held on the second Monday of every month from 7 PM to 9 PM at 71 Sip Ave., 6th Floor. Our meetings are also streamed via Facebook.

## Get Involved

Membership is open to all residents of Jersey City, owners of residential property, and businesses within the boundaries set forth in our bylaws. The JSQCA is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization, so member dues and donations are tax-deductible.
