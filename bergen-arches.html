<p>The Bergen Arches is a mile-long, below-grade rail corridor running through the heart of Ward C &mdash; and it's on its way to becoming one of Jersey City's most significant green spaces. The JSQCA has been an active supporter of this project since its early days.</p>

<h2>What Are the Bergen Arches?</h2>
<p>The Bergen Arches (formally the "Erie Cut") is an abandoned four-track railroad trench blasted through Bergen Hill between 1906 and 1910 by the Erie Railroad. The cut runs roughly from Palisade Avenue (near the Heights) to Tonnelle Avenue/Route 1&9, passing between the Journal Square and Heights neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Six arched bridges and tunnels were built along its length to keep intersecting streets intact &mdash; giving the corridor its name. At its deepest, the trench sits 40 to 85 feet below street level and spans approximately 60 feet wide, covering about 17 acres.</p>
<p>The last passenger train passed through in 1957. Over more than 60 years of abandonment, the cut has grown into a dense urban forest &mdash; one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the area.</p>

<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>The plan is to transform the Bergen Arches into a <strong>shared-use greenway and transit corridor</strong> &mdash; a linear park with pedestrian and cycling trails, preserved natural habitat, and adaptively reused historic tunnels. The project is frequently compared to New York City's High Line.</p>
<p>Key elements of the vision include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A pedestrian and cycling trail running the full length of the corridor</li>
  <li>Preservation of the established urban forest and ecology</li>
  <li>Adaptive reuse of historic tunnels for community, cultural, and educational programming</li>
  <li>Five equitably distributed access points along the corridor</li>
  <li>Potential integration with sustainable public transit</li>
  <li>No vehicular traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bergen Arches would also serve as a critical link connecting the <a href="https://greenway.org/">East Coast Greenway</a> (a national trail from Maine to Florida), the <strong>Essex-Hudson Greenway</strong> (a 9-mile car-free pathway connecting 8 communities from Montclair to Jersey City), and the <strong>Sixth Street Embankment</strong> greenway toward the Jersey City waterfront.</p>

  <h2>Current Status</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Bergen Arches Greenway &amp; Transit Feasibility Study</strong>, commissioned by Jersey City's Department of Infrastructure and conducted by Supermass Studio, Arup, and NHDM, was completed in 2024. It was funded by a $100,000 state grant and won a <strong>2025 ASLA-NY Honor Award</strong>. The full study is available at the <a href="https://bergenarchesstudy-jerseycity.hub.arcgis.com/">Bergen Arches Feasibility Study Hub</a>.</p>
  <p>In 2025, NJ Transit announced a <strong>$22.28 million Phase 2 design contract</strong> for a Bus Rapid Transit Transitway from Secaucus to Jersey City that would use the Bergen Arches corridor. Community advocates, including BAPC, are pushing for <strong>coexistence of greenway and transit uses</strong> within the corridor.</p>
