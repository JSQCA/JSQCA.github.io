<h2>Working together to build a better community &mdash; Clean, Green, and Safe.</h2>

<p>
  The Journal Square Community Association represents residents, owners of
  residential property, and businesses in the Journal Square area.
</p>

<p>
  We serve as a voice for the community in dealing with the city, county,
  developers, local businesses, and other community groups. We bring people
  together at monthly meetings so they can connect with their neighbors and
  remain updated about our neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
  Membership is open to all residents of Jersey City, owners of residential
  property, and businesses within the boundaries set forth in our by-laws. The
  JSQCA is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization, so member dues
  and donations are tax-deductible. We normally meet from 7 PM to 9 PM on the
  second Monday of the month. Our meetings are held at
  71 Sip Ave., 6th Floor. Our meetings are also
  streamed via Facebook.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to monthly meetings, members can join committees that address
  some of the concerns of the Association. <a href="/#committees">Learn more
