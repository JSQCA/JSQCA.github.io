<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<h2>Working together to build a better community â€” Clean, Green, and Safe.</h2>

<p>
  The Journal Square Community Association represents residents, owners of 
  residential property, and businesses in the Journal Square area.
</p>

<p>
  We serve as a voice for the community in dealing with the city, county, 
  developers, local businesses, and other community groups. We bring people 
  together at monthly meetings so they can connect with their neighbors and 
  remain updated about our neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
  Membership is open to all residents of Jersey City, owners of residential 
  property, and businesses within the boundaries set forth in our by-laws. The 
  JSQCA is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization, so member dues 
  and donations are tax-deductible. We normally meet from 7 PM to 9 PM on the 
  second Monday of the month. Our meetings are held at the Hudson County 
  Community College at 71 Sip Avenue, 2nd floor. Our meetings are also 
  streamed via Facebook.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to monthly meetings, members can join committees that address 
  some of the concerns of the Association. <a href="/committees">Learn more
